1. Annoymous Inner class -
    Are classes without name , implemented by
    AnnoInterface annoInterface = new AnnoInterface()
    {//this is annonymous inner class that is implementing AnnoInterface and therfore implementing both methods
            @Override
            public void display() {
                System.out.println("Hi From Annonymous Inner Class Display Method");
            }
            @Override
            public String giveName() {
                return "demo";
            }
        };

2. Lambda Exp :
        Are special type of annonymous inner classes that have exactly one abstract method
        Those annoymous inner class that one method , can be converted to lambda exp

3. Annonymous Inner classes are more powerful than Lambda exp as they can support multiple abstract methods
4. Lambda exp if we are using return the its compulsory to implement inside curly braces { }
5. Default methods in Interfaces from java 8 allows classes to implement only if required.
    Interfaces allows for multiple inheritance if and only of child class has implemented provided implementation of
    default methods.
6. Method refrences only works in case of functional interfaces
